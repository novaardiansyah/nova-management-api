# Nova Management 

Nova Management is an admin dashboard website application that is used for various personal purposes but by prioritizing the concept of reuse, where this application can be re-customized easily and quickly to adapt to different needs.

We also made the app easy to switch functions for a variety of purposes, with just a few easy steps to change the app as a whole, dynamically managed menus, and display it only when you need it. 

We provide access role features that can be easily used and can be set up via the admin page, making access rights no longer an obstacle to developing and working in teams.

We provide this feature-rich application for both you personally and your team to be used for free and also legally, get full access to the application along with all the dummy schemes and data needed to get started, although this application is completely free and can be freely used, you need to understand and comply that this "Nova Management" application is protected by the [MIT License](https://github.com/novaardiansyah/nova-management/blob/main/LICENSE) and all copyrights of the creator.

### How to Use

To view and use the app in the demo mode that is already available, you can try to log in to [the system](http://nova-management.is-best.net/) using several accounts with different level access.

We free you to make any changes in the system, we are happy to see you try all the facilities we provide, we only wish you the best, we also hope you are kind enough to leave an impression and message for us, so that we can get better in the future.

We challenge you to challenge us to create complementary features that are roughly suitable for the development of this application but we don't have them yet, we also challenge you to dare to report problems in the big issue if indeed it interferes with your comfort and security in our system.

Here is a list of accounts that we provide according to the existing access level, and are free for you to use:
